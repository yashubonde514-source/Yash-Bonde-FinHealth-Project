⚡ FinHealth – SaveIQ: AI Savings Goal Tracker & Analytics Dashboard
Tests AI Engine Platform License: MIT

SaveIQ is an enterprise-grade personal finance and automated savings management platform. It bridges cloud-based spreadsheet persistence with real-time generative AI intelligence powered by Groq Cloud (Llama 3.3 70B) and a standalone modern web dashboard preview.

🌟 Key Highlights & Capabilities
1. 🎯 Dynamic Savings Goal Engine (Scenario 1)
Atomic Goal Ingestion: Auto-generates unique IDs (GID-XXXX), validates target amounts, and prevents deadline discrepancies.
Dynamic Formula Injection: Automates live calculations for Remaining Balance, Progress %, Days Remaining, Required Daily Savings Rate, and Status.
Interactive Modals: Sleek, glassmorphic UI with real-time projection previews before saving.
2. 🧠 Groq AI Intelligent Financial Advisory (Scenario 2)
High-Speed Inference: Connects to Groq Cloud's LPU architecture using llama-3.3-70b-versatile (or llama-3.1-8b-instant).
Contextual Coaching: Ingests goal metadata, category nuances (e.g. Emergency, Tech, Travel, Education, Lifestyle), and deadline pressure to deliver high-impact, realistic budgeting tweaks.
Resilient Fallback: Built-in deterministic rule-based heuristic engine when offline or if no API key is configured.
3. ⏱️ Automated Daily Audit & Transactional Alerts (Scenario 3)
State Machine Transitions: Transitions goal lifecycle across ACTIVE, NEARING_DEADLINE (<= 7 days), COMPLETED (100%), and OVERDUE.
Responsive HTML Emails: Automatically dispatches styled transactional alerts highlighting deadlines, daily targets, and AI coaching.
Quota Buffer Defense: Monitors daily email quotas to preserve transactional delivery.
Audit Trails: Appends chronological execution logs to Audit_Logs sheet.
4. 📊 Executive Analytics & KPI Dashboard (Scenario 4)
KPI Summary Grid: Total Goals, Target Capital, Total Saved, Portfolio Velocity, Active/Completed/Overdue counters.
Visual Analytics: Interactive doughnut and category distribution charts (Chart.js / Native Google Sheets 3D charts).
In-Cell Sparklines: Visual progress bars embedded directly into spreadsheet cells.
5. 🛡️ Security Hardening & Formula Protection
Formula Column Locking: Protects calculated columns (Columns F, G, I, J, K) from accidental user edits.
CSV / Formula Injection Shield: Disarms malicious formula prefixes (=, +, -, @) upon user input.
API Cooldown Throttling: 1,000ms debounce protection against runaway API execution.
